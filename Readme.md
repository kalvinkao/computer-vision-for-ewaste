# Computer Vision Model for my W210 Project
### This repo contains my code for:
 - exploring the 2017 COCO training data,
 - augmenting images,
 - updating and creating COCO annotation files,
 - re-training object detection models, and
 - evaluating model performance
 
#### CLEAN UP IS IN PROGRESS!
To be added:
 - instructions for use (including the base deep learning AMI and EC2 instance type)
 - a public AMI for runnning the code
 - lessons learned
